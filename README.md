# FuzzyProtonShooter

College project. 3D shooter game where the objective is to shoot fuzzy blobs while being at a nominal distance from it.
Too far from the blob and it can't be shot and being too near kills the player. 

Requires OpenGL standard header files - gl.h, glu.h and an additional windowing API glut.h
